Realtime Community Signage Server : About
========

This code lets manage a cheap realtime community signs installed in other locations.  This server aggregates all the content, and then you can assign different transit or calendar information to each sign.

The server code here is still pretty rough - not a lot of commenting, unstructured testing, and the instructions are missing some pieces.

This is part of the Lost In Boston Realtime project of the MIT Center for Civic Media. This project is about helping people work together to make their neighborhoods more visitor-friendly. Community groups are partnering with local businesses and institutions to install digital signage that call out useful information in their area.

Read the INSTALL.md for detailed setup instructions.
